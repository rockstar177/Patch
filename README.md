# Patch
I found a video on the Internet about how to write a patch for a program. The author outlined everything in detail.
All this was done on x86 architecture, but for some reason I wanted to port these applications to other architectures.
As a result, ported to: mips, armhf and s390x. In the last folder you will also find the results of my experiments. 
# Thanks for reading. Hope this code helps you. Everything was written for self-development and learning.
